# Am I funding human rights abuses?
## The Story behind BEHR News
#### by Matthew Phillips

&nbsp;

I still remember the sense of shame I felt when I learned that there are more people in slavery
today than at any other point in history. Shame, because I grew up under the illusion that modern
humanity had somehow progressed from that sort of thing, that the long arc of history bent
towards justice was thoroughly _bent_. So how do you explain the estimated 28 million people
working in conditions of forced labor today? [^1]

My journey to find an answer to this question led me through a maze of investigative journalism,
handfuls of books, and reporting from dozens of organizations committed to ending slavery.
I was surprised by how much information exists publicly online for anyone who is curious enough
to go searching for it. But this fact leads to a puzzling questionâ€”if the information is
available online, why don't more people know about it? For example, most of the chocolate you might
buy for halloween has been implicated with human rights abuses for years. And you may have heard about
blood diamonds, but what about slavery in the seafood industry or in the metals fueling our tech
economy? 

Our increasing awareness of climate change and environmental degredation has increased our 
sympathy for environmental protection and sustainability, but a lesser known fact is how much
of our modern pension for environmental destruction goes hand-in-hand with forced labor and
human rights abuses. One estimate from the University of Sussex estimates that if slavery were a
country, it would be "the third largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, after China and 
the United States." [^2]

So what do we do about it? My own answer came to me when I was in early days of discovering all
of this and felt exhausted and overwhelmed by a million open browser tabs and unread books. An
unexpected car accident led to a whirlwind of changes in my life when, like Jules of [_Pulp Fiction_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mw8NR6p8gyI)
who stood facing a volley of gunfire at close range only to look around and discover that every single bullet
had missed him, I too miraculously walked away unscathed. Except in my case, instead of renouncing
a life of crime, I decided to backpack through Europe. I had been staying with a friend in The Hague,
mulling over international crime and desperately thinking that if only people _knew_ about
modern slavery then maybe something might happen. Maybe more people would start asking questions about 
where certain of our products come from, and maybe more corporations whose products we buy
would be held to account for the human rights abuses and environmental destruction they facilitate.
Many of the solutions to humanity's greatest challenges have started out as a problem of
information and awareness. So after a few craft Belgian beers, I had the epiphany to _make an app_. 
Having never built an app, my journey began by going down the rabbit hole of front-end
development and web design to create something that could inform people of the human and
environmental absuses committed by corporations in the global supply chain.

The result is [Business, Environment & Human Rights News](https://www.behr.news), a news aggregator
and search engine meant to make it easier to find information about the problems I have been
discussing. It currently showcases the publications of a select few organizations with
consistently excellent reporting and investigative depth. What you see is the minimum I have
been able to accomplish so far, and I hope to add more resources and features in the future to
provide the best informative resource on human rights and environmental issues. In the coming
week I will write another blog post discussing the technical aspects, limitations, and future
direction of the project.

Throughout this effort I have been motivated by an almost Captain Ahab-like obsession to do
whatever I can to contribute to these global humanitarian problems. Being a software developer,
this project is the least I can do. It may not change anything, but there is a certain feeling
of euphoria in trying. There's a memorable passage in _Moby Dick_ when, after the white whale
severs Captain Ahab's leg and he embarks on an obsessive journey to avenge him,
Starbuck questions his motive for taking revenge on a creature who is simply a "dumb brute," after
which Ahab replies, "I would strike out the sun if it
insulted me, for could the sun do that, then could I do the other, since there is ever a sort
of fair play herein." In the more [colloquial words](https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/president-george-w-bush-delivers-his-famous-fool-me-once-news-footage/1271658781) 
of George W. Bush, "fool me, can't get fooled again."

You can't unknow what you know. The upside is that the more you know, the more you are able to act.
The irony is not lost on me that Starbucks Corporation, named after that same character in _Moby Dick_, has
recently had a lawsuit brought against it for sourcing its coffee beans from a supplier known to use
slave labor. [^3] If large corporations cannot be counted on to do their own due diligence, someone
else has to.
